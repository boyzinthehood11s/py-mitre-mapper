# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Tool

## Overview
This project maps detected services and behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques to support threat modeling and security analysis.

## What the Tool Does
- Analyzes detected services
- Maps them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Generates a structured threat report
- Provides a standardized way to describe attacker behavior

## Why This Matters
MITRE ATT&CK provides a common language for security teams.  
Understanding how technical findings relate to adversary behavior is critical.

## Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Threat modeling
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Adversary tactics and techniques
- Security analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MITRE ATT&CK concepts
- Structured data mapping

## Example Use Case
